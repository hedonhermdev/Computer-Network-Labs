2. Locate the PORT command in the Wireshark trace and try to correlate it with the command entered by you in the ftp terminal. Analyze the parameters of PORT command.
> locate using filter "ftp and ip.addr == 192.168.29.202"
> Sends the PORT command in the form of "PORT n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6" where client IP address (nl.n2.n3.n4) and port (n5 x 256 + n6)

3. How  the server  is  able  to  send  PORT  command  successful,  even  when  the  three-way  handshake required  to  complete  the  TCP  connection  that  got  initiated  due  to  PORT  command  has  not  been completed.

> Control connection was already open

4. The FTP server sends file listings back across the data connection, rather than as multiline replies across the control connection. Try to verify this fact by listing the remote directory using “dir” command and analyzing the Wireshark packet capture.
