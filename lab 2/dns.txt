Q1. What is the transport layer protocol?
> UDP

Q2. What is the transaction ID of this message? Is it same as that of corresponding DNS query message?
> 0x00004d4c
> Yes, must be same

Q3. Along with the answer, is there any authoritative name server also. What is its type and what does it signifies?
> Yes
> Type: SOA (Start Of a zone of Authority)
> An SOA record is a Start of Authority. Every domain must have a Start of Authority record at the cutover point where the domain is delegated from its parent domain. For example, if the domain mycompany.com is delegated to DNSimple name servers, we must include an SOA record for the name mycompany.com in our authoritative DNS records. We add this record automatically for every domain added to DNSimple. We show this record to you as a System Record on your domainâ€™s Manage page.

Q4. Is there any other field (for example additional records, etc.)? What it signifies?
***DOUBT***
> I see mailbox server being returned but not sure if that is meant by the question as Additional RRs field is 0
