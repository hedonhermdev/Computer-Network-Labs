1. What does \r\n mean after each line?
> Carriage return, line feed

2. What indicates the end of HTTP message?
> The end of HTTP headers is defined by an empty line (\r\n)
> The end of the complete message is defined by the end of the data that has size (number of bytes) specified in header

3. What is the version of HTTP used? Is it necessary to pass it in message? Why?
> 1.1
> Yes, since HTTP has different versions with varying features

4. What type of connection it is: persistent or non-persistent?
> Persistent, due to present of "Connection: keep-alive" option

5. What is the source IP address and destination IP address?
> Mentioned in IP header

6. Which TCP protocol does HTTP use?
> v6

7. What is the source and destination port number?
> Mentioned in TCP header

8. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until HTTP OK reply was received?
> Simply see time difference

9. What is the difference between date header and Last-modified header in HTTP OK reply.?
> Date is current time
> Last modified is the time the origin (server) believes the resource was last modified
> Last modified may be used as a huerestic for cache checking in case other headers like cache control are missing

10. Although URL specifies the host, why do you think that it is again the part of HTTP GET message?
> The "Host" header field in a request provides the host and port
information from the target URI, enabling the origin server to
distinguish among resources while servicing requests for multiple
host names on a single IP address.
> In name-based virtual hosting, also called shared IP hosting, the virtual hosts serve multiple hostnames on a single machine with a single IP address. This is possible because when a web browser requests a resource from a web server using HTTP/1.1 it includes the requested hostname as part of the request.

11. Does HTTP work on specific port? How can it be verified from GET and OK messages.
> Yes, destination port 80 in GET and source port is 80 in OK
