Try to answer following questions:

1.Even after the link-failure does node $n(0) continues to send packets constantly. Why?
UDP does not know because of lack of reliability, congestion control, etc.

2.Try the same simulation with TCP traffic and answer Q1.
TCP stops receiving ACK on link failure so it thinks that the node is congested and it does congestion control. It lowers down it's send rate.

3.Why node $n(0) is not using the alternate path after the link-failure?
Due to static routing.
